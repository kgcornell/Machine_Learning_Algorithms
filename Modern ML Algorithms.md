# Discussion on Modern Machine Learning Algorithms
Machine Learning Algorithms can be categorized as either:
* Generative and Discriminative
* Parametric and Non-Parametric
* Supervised and Unsupervised

There is no one algorithm that works best for every problem. The choice of algorithm should be dependent on factors such as size and structure of the data set. Thus many algorithms should be tried out on a given data set.

## Machine Leanrning Tasks:
* Regression
* Classification
* Clustering

### Regression
A machine learning task is identified as a regression task when our end goal is to predict continuous, numeric values. We have a set of predictors that are used to predict the response. Examples include predicting stock prices, student test scores etc,

There are various regression algorithms that can be used:
* Linear Regression - There are various ways of fitting linear regression models
  * Least Squares
  * Lasso
  * Ridge
  * Elastic Net
* Regression Trees
* Deep Learning
* Nearest Neighbors
