# Deep Learning - Theory
Most deep learning algorithms are based on an optimization algorithm called stochastic gradient descent.

In the domain of unsupervised learning, the aim of deep learning models is to learn the entire probability distribution that generated the data set in the first place. This is useful for tasks involving density estimation or implicitly for tasks like synthesis or denoising.
